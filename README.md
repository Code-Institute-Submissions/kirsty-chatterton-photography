## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a personal photography portfolio to show the different types of images I have captured throughtout my time as a hobbyist photographer. The website will show that I have experience photographing events, landscapes, pets and street photography. By creating this website, I hope to start receiving paid work and/or collaboration work that will help me gain more experience in the field and improve my skills as a photographer.

* As a **user**, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content
* As a **user**, I want to see what type of work the photographer has done
* As a **user**, I want to find out more about the photographer and where they're located so I can book them for an event or other photography session
