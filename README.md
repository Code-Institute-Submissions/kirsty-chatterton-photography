## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a personal photography portfolio to show the different types of images I have captured throughtout my time as a hobbyist photographer. The website will show that I have experience photographing events, landscapes, pets and street photography. By creating this website, I hope to start receiving paid work and/or collaboration work that will help me gain more experience in the field and improve my skills as a photographer.

### User Goals

* As a **user**, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site on my first visit
* As a **user**, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content
* As a **user**, I want to see what type of work the photographer has done
* As a **user**, I want to find out more about the photographer and where they're located so I can book them for an event or other photography sessions
* As a **user**, I want to be able to easily contact the photographer to book them for an event or session, and to ask any other quesions I may have about their work

### Site Owner Goals

* As a **site owner**, I want the name of the site to be the main feature of the home page so the user can understand what the site is on their first visit
* As a **site owner**, I want to include navigation links on every page so the user can easily navigate throughout site
* As a **site owner**, I want to include a gallery featuring the different styles of images I have captured to show the user what type of work I have done
* As a **site owner**, I want to include a short bio to give the user a breif overview of who I am and what I do as well as let them know where I'm located if they wish to book a session
* As a **site owner**, I want to include links to social media pages I am regularly active on so the user can easily contact me and see what I've been up to recently if they're interested

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

![Color Scheme Generated by coolors.co](assets/images/color-palette.jpg)

#### Typography

Poppins and Raleway

#### Imagery

The images featured on this site are all my own images that I have captured over the last couple of years as part of my job and also in my free time. These include images of work events/gigs, landscapes, street style photography, and my personal favourite - pets. Although for now, this section only features dogs!  

### Wireframes

The wireframes for my site were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The site is made up of three pages with a modal feature on each page which is the "About Me" section. There is also a gallery page and a contact page. I created wireframes for desktop as well as mobile and tablet.
